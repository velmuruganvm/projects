these are IEEE 754 format Float-add/sub, float multiplier and cordicn10
cordicn10  is used to calculate sine cosine and function using 10 iterations using float adder/sub module and multiplier module .
it can also calculate tan inverse function by need to multiply with 57.32 to get absolute value

checked all modules provide high accuracy in short time
wrote Verilog code and verified in altera Quartus.
for cordicn10{
change value for c to sine and cos values in output described above
change value for b to calculate atan or taninverse value.

use vr=1 for tan inverse (output=o3)and vr=0 for sine and cos (output cos =o1 and sine =o2)
}
please review my work (also error)
please feel free to add additional modules.....

please feel free to mail or message me in mail id velmuruganvm15in@gmail.com
correction and review are welcomed
please use pycordictan.txt file for checking the values from the stimulation for cos, sin and tan inverse
please use the zip files if you are not feeling the code is wrong or functional behaviour is wrong
